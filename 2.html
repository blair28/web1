  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
    The IRCA Cherubim Cats developed from 1971-1994 (23 years) were used as the foundation cats for the RagaMuffin Breed and included the IRCA Miracle Ragdolls, Ragdolls, Honey Bears, and Maxamillion lines.

    In contrast, their cousin the Ragdoll Breed was founded with only the IRCA Ragdoll lines developed from 1971-1975 (4 years).

    Currently, acceptable outcrossings are as follows: ACFA (Siberian), CFA (Long Haired Selkirk Rex, Straight), GCCF (British Longhair).

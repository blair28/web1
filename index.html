  <h2>Breed divergence</h2>
  <p>
    In 1994, a group of IRCA breeders decided to leave and form their own group because of the increasing restrictions. Owing to Baker's trademark on the name Ragdoll and ‘’Cherubim’’, the group renamed its stock of IRCA Cherubim Cats Ragamuffins. While the originally proposed name was Liebling, the name RagaMuffin was put forth as an alternative by Curt Gehm, one of the group's founders, and it was chosen.

    In the spirit of bettering the breed's genetic health, personality, and temperament, the group selectively allowed a limited amount of outcross to Domestic Longhair cats that appeared to already fit the Standard of Perfection established in ACFA. Later, once the Domestic Longhair Cat allowance expired, outcrosses allowed historically include Persians. The group also allowed some limited outcrossing to IRCA Ragdolls initially (ended in 2010 for ACFA-recognized Ragamuffins). Only cats with at least one RagaMuffin parent and an accepted outcross in ACFA/CFA/GCCF currently qualify to be called Authentic RagaMuffins.

    The first cat association to accept the breed at full show champion status was the United Feline Organization (UFO), and shortly that same year it was accepted into the American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA). Finally, the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) accepted them into the Miscellaneous class in February, 2003 and advanced them to Championship class in February, 2011.

    The most obvious difference between typical RagaMuffins and Ragdolls is the required point coloration in Ragdolls, where as the RagaMuffin is allowed any color and pattern. The Standard of Perfection describes the RagaMuffin as requiring a ‘Sweet’ overall expression with large, rounded with pinch at the corner Walnut Shaped Eyes versus the Ragdoll’s thinner, slightly angled Almond Shaped eyes. Adding to the sweet expression, RagaMuffins have rounded contours between the ears and a nose scoop versus the Ragdoll which calls for flat planes. RagaMuffins call for a flatter topline and Ragdolls call for a more angular topline with the raised hind quarter. RagaMuffin coats are to be Plush in texture and the Ragdoll allows for both Silky or Plush coats.
